# Bloc Browse

Quickly open Bloc student roadmaps.

## Getting Started

1. Place the `bloc-browse` file in `/usr/local/bin`
2. Make it executable by navigating to `/usr/local/bin` in Terminal and running the following: `chmod +x bloc-browse`

## How to use

```bash
bloc-browse student-name
```

This will open `http://bloc.io/users/student-name/checkpoints` in your default browser.

Cheers!
